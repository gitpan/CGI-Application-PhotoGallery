NAME
    CGI::Application::PhotoGallery - module to provide a simple photo
    gallery

SYNOPSIS
        use CGI::Application::PhotoGallery;
    
        my $webapp = CGI::Application::PhotoGallery->new(
            PARAMS => {
                photos_dir  => '/path/to/photos'
            }
        );
    
        $webapp->run();

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Application::PhotoGallery is a CGI::Application module allowing
    people to create their own simple photo gallery. There is no need to
    generate your own thumbnails since they are created on the fly (using
    either the GD or Image::Magick modules).

    To use this module you need to create an instance script. It should look
    like:

        #!/usr/bin/perl
    
        use CGI::Application::PhotoGallery;
    
        my $webapp = CGI::Application::PhotoGallery->new(
            PARAMS => {
                photos_dir  => '/path/to/photos'
            }
        );
    
        $webapp->run();

    You'll need to replace the "/path/to/photos" with the real path to your
    photos (see the photos_dir options below).

    Put this somewhere where CGIs can run and name it something like
    "index.cgi".

    This gets you the default behavior and look. To get something more to
    your specifications you can use the options described below.

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

OPTIONS
    CGI::Application modules accept options using the PARAMS arguement to
    "new()". To give options for this module you change the "new()" call in
    the instance script shown above:

        my $webapp = CGI::Application::PhotoGallery->new(
            PARAMS => {
                photos_dir  => '/path/to/photos',
                title       => 'My Photos'
            }
        );

    The "title" option tells PhotoGallery to use 'My Photos' as the title
    rather than the default value. See below for more information about
    "title" and other options.

  photos_dir (required)
    This parameter is used to specify where all of your photos are located.

    Previous limitations of this directory have been lifted.

    Your photos directory can have any number of images and sub-directories
    of images. This is applied recursively so a gallery can have any number
    of sub-galleries.

  script_name
    This parameter uses $0 by default, you can change it (or set it to the
    empty string) if you neeed to. It is needed for creating self
    referencial links.

  title
    By default every page will start with the title "My Photo Gallery". You
    can specify your own using the title parameter.

  thumb_size
    By default PhotoGallery displays thumbnail images that are 100 x 100 on
    the index page. You can change this by specifying a number (in pixels)
    for this option.

  preview_thumbs
    Before viewing the entire contents of a gallery, you are shown a few
    preview image. The default number of thumbnails is 4. You can change it
    by specifying your own value in the instance script.

  graphics_lib
    You can specifify which graphics library you wish to use to size your
    thumbnails. Included in this package are "Magick" (Image::Magick) and
    the default: "GD". You can also create your own if you wish.

  index_template
    This application uses HTML::Template to generate its HTML pages. If you
    would like to customize the HTML you can copy the default form template
    and edit it to suite your needs. The default form template is called
    'photos_index.tmpl' and you can get it from the distribution or from
    wherever this module ended up in your @INC. Pass in the path to your
    custom template as the value of this parameter.

    See HTML::Template for more information about the template syntax.

  single_template
    The default template for an individual photo is called
    'photos_single.tmpl' and you can get it from the distribution or from
    wherever this module ended up in your @INC. Pass in the path to your
    custom template as the value of this parameter.

    See HTML::Template for more information about the template syntax.

  max_width
    Setting this value will force the browser to scale images down to this
    particular width and proportioned height. This is done by setting the
    width and height attributes on the image tag, thus saving the image will
    retain the full resolution.

  max_height
    Setting this value will force the browser to scale images down to this
    particular height and proportioned width. This is done by setting the
    width and height attributes on the image tag, thus saving the image will
    retain the full resolution.

  cache_root
    Specifies where the file cache data will be stored. Defaults to
    FileCache under the OS-specific temporary filesdirectory (e.g.
    /tmp/FileCache). You may want to move this to make the cache persist.
    Under selinux, however, be careful to put it in a webserver-writable
    directory.

  cache_namespace
    Specifies the namespace for this gallery's cache data. Defaults to the
    gallery title - or 'default'. Changing this will orphan the cache data.

  cache_dirumask
    Specifies the umask value to use when cache directories are created.
    Defaults to 0007 to avoid cache poisioning attacks.

  cache_datumask
    Specifies the umask value to use when cache data is written. Defaults to
    006 to avoid cache poisioning attacks. Note that this becomes the umask
    for all files written by this script. (See Cache::FileCache
    documentation for why.)

CAPTIONS
    You can include captions for your photos by creating a tab-separated
    database named "captions.txt" in your "photos_dir". The filename should
    be specified relative of your "photos_dir".

        1.jpg   This is a caption.
        Test Gallery/1.jpg  This is another caption.

METHODS
  setup( )
    This method sets the default options and makes sure all required
    parameteres are set.

  get_photos( $dir )
    This method finds all of the "image/*" files in the specified directory.

  mime_types( )
    This method will create (if needed) and return a new MIME::Types object.

  gfx_lib( )
    This method will create (if needed) and return the graphics adaptor
    specified by the user (default is GD).

  cache( )
    This method will create (if needed) and return a Cache::FileCache
    object,

RUN MODES
  gallery_index( )
    Reads in the contents of your "photos_dir" and generates an index of
    photos.

  thumbnail( )
    Generates a thumbnail for the requested image using the selected
    graphics library.

  show_image( )
    Sends the contents of the image to the browser.

  single_index( )
    Fills and sends the template for viewing an individual image.
