CGI::Application::PhotoGallery - module to provide a simple photo gallery.

This module is a CGI::Application module allowing people to create their
own simple photo gallery. There is no need to generate your own
own thumbnails since they are created on the fly (using either the GD or
Image::Magick modules).


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

The module requires the following modules, available on CPAN:

  CGI::Application
  HTML::Template
  File::Basename

Also, it requires a graphics library to generate the thumbnails. By default
CGI::Application::PhotoGallery uses GD, however Image::Magick can be used
instead.
